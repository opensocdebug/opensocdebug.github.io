<h1>About Open SoC Debug</h1>

<p>Open SoC Debug is a new project co-managed by
the <a href="http://www.optimsoc.org">OpTiMSoC</a>
and <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org">lowRISC</a> projects with
the mission to establish a repository of common SoC debug
components. While our original focus is on hardware building
blocks and their interface on the debug host, we highly welcome
debug software developers to broaden the scope of Open SoC
Debug.</p>
